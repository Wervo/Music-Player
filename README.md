## Learned

This is by far the most difficult project that I have faced, it is different from my other projects. I never created something like an audio project, so I didn't know any syntax of the progress bar and audio as a whole. I had received help, but I made sure that help wasn't too much and I understood the code. When I was working on it, I knew what to do, but I didn't know any syntax to use for that project, like the audio, progress bar, and minutes/seconds. Now that I have completed it, I have learned alot of doing a music player project.
